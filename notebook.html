      <p3>Why I use Signal, ProtonMail, ProtonVPN, MacOS and the rest, and why you should too.</p3>

    <br></br>
    <p3>Let's be honest, everything we do is monitored. Someone is always watching - be it online or in the streets. You'll never be truly <i>alone</i>. I don't like this at all. I apricatiate that this could be done for my saftey (think CCTV) but I
      don't like the police deploying facial recognition cameras in the public. As people, we have rights, and the right to privacy is one which I'll gladly stand by. So, for the specifics. (there is some xover from my "things" page, where I go into
      some details as to why I use these privacy focussed products, so please bear with me if you've read that one too). <br></br>
      <b>Proton Services (Mail and VPN)</b><br>
      ProtonTechnologies is a created by ex-CERN employees. Their mission is to create a privacy centric internet. ProtonMail takes avil of client-side encryption to protect email content and user data <b>before</b> they are sent to ProtonMail
      servers. This means that even if the proton servers are compromised, your data is encrpted & safe from prying eyes.
