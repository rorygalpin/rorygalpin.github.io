<div class="about">
<p2>
  The following is a collection of tools, services and tech that I use on the daily. I'll give you my experiences, reviews and opinions on these. You might not agree. That's expected. Let me know what you think by <a href="https://rorygalpin.github.io/about">reaching out</a>.

<div class="about">

  <p2><b>bunsenlabs.</b></p2><br>
  <div class="abt-2"> <p3>Bunsenlabs OS is a very light-weight linux flavour built on the top of debain. Dubbed "the little distro that could" by linuxunplugged.com, its an easy choice for you linux needs. Bunsenlabs will run on outdated hardware without a struggle. You'll rethink the right-click with bunsenlabs, you access everything though the right click.</p3> </div>
    <br></br>

    <p2><b>signal.</b></p2><br>
    <div class="abt-2"> <p3> <a href="https://www.signal.org">signal</a> is a (<i>the</i>) open source encrypted instant messenger app. Being open source, the code can be, and is, reviewed by the best in the business, and remains free from big-tech's prying eyes (*cough* whatsapp *cough*). Signal is the European Commission's <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-commission-to-staff-switch-to-signal-messaging-app/"> messenger of choice</a>, however a <a href="https://guce.techcrunch.com/copyConsent?sessionId=3_cc-session_4c536b58-07c7-423c-91a3-171ab68c0974&lang=en-IE">new EU ruling</a> may legally require signal to create a back-door into their service.</p3> </div>
      <br></br>

      <p2><b>protonmail.</b></p2><br>
      <div class="abt-2"> <p3>simiarlly to signal, protonmail is an encrypted communication service. ProtonMail was develped by scientisit working at CERN, Geneva. ProtonMail uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side_encryption">client-side</a> encryption, meaning Proton's servers only receive the encrypted message, before passing it on and decrypting it. </p3> </div>
        <br></br>

        <p2><b>protonvpn.</b></p2><br>
        <div class="abt-2"> <p3>owned by the same parent company as protonmail, (proton technologies) protonvpn provides a free and fast vpn service as well as paid services. ProtonVPN utilizes OpenVPN (UDP/TCP) and the IKEv2 protocol, with AES-256 encryption. Proton technologies has a strict 0 logs policy, unlike most free VPN services.</p3> </div>
          <br></br>

          <p2><b>macos.</b></p2><br>
          <div class="abt-2"> <p3>Apple Dork? yes. Just to look cool in coffe shops? also yes. But mostly because I like security, privacy and I need to trust the OS / hardware combo I'm using. I need it to be stable, and unix. MacOS is by no means fault proof, but it's trackrecord is so much better than it's windows and linux counterparts.</p3> </div>
